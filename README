Introduction

The package sys-apps/systemd was added to the portage tree in June of 2011, and
since then support for it has only been growing. As of now (March, 2012),
almost any hardware configuration it's able to run Linux with systemd.
The systemd package is written as a drop-in replacement for sysvinit; however,
Gentoo utilizes OpenRC, a different init system that runs on top of sysvinit.
This makes it impossible for systemd to use any of the init scripts that Gentoo
packages normally install in /etc/init.d.
The Gentoo developers that introduced systemd into the portage tree decided
(quite wisely) that systemd should be able to be installed in parallel to
OpenRC, so that users will be able to test it first and get back to the default
setup if something went wrong, or if the user didn't liked systemd.
However, it is not possible to install systemd as the only init system in a
Gentoo machine right now: the package sys-apps/baselayout is included in the
@system set, and baselayout depends on openrc, so every single Gentoo
installation includes both packages, unless the user explicitly configures her
system to avoid the installation of said packages.
This overlay is an experiment to see how difficult it is to remove openrc from
a Gentoo system, so it runs only with systemd. I will try to keep the overlay
in sync with the portage tree until the proposed

Why

Why not?
More seriously, Gentoo is about choice. Some of us that choose to use systemd
see no reason on having OpenRC/baselayout installed; it's the same the other
way around, an OpenRC user should not need to have systemd installed on her
machine.

Instructions


  1. Before anything, BACKUP YOUR SYSTEM AND YOUR PORTAGE CONFIGURATION. Make a
     backup of:

          /var/lib/portage/world
          /etc/portage
          /etc/make.conf
          /etc/runlevels
          /etc/init.d
          /etc/conf.d

     WARNING: IF YOU FAIL TO FOLLOW THESE STEPS PROPERLY, YOU MAY RENDER YOUR
     SYSTEM UNUSABLE. EVEN IF YOU FOLLOW THESE STEPS PROPERLY, YOU MAY RENDER
     YOUR SYSTEM UNUSABLE. MAKE SURE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING. I TAKE NO
     RESPONSABILITY IF THIS OVERLAY EATS YOUR SYSTEM AND THEN RUNS AWAY WITH
     ALL YOUR VALUABLES.
     That being said: If you are already using systemd, the removal of sys-
     apps/openrc should not affect your system; the removal of sys-apps/
     sysvinit should also be safe, provided that you install sys-apps/sysvinit-
     tools and sys-apps/systemd-sysv-utils; and the removal of sys-apps/
     baselayout should also be safe, provided that you install sys-apps/
     systemd-baselayout.
  2. Add the directory with the gentoo-systemd-only overlay to the
     PORTDIR_OVERLAY variable in /etc/make.conf:

          PORTDIR_OVERLAY="/path/to/gentoo-systemd-only"

  3. Edit /etc/portage/profile/packages (create it if it doesn't exists) and
     add the following lines:

          -*>=sys-apps/baselayout-2
          *>=sys-apps/systemd-baselayout-2

     The first line removes baselayout from the @system set, the second one
     adds sys-apps/systemd-baselayout to it.
  4. Edit /etc/portage/package.keywords and add sys-apps/sysvinit-tools, sys-
     apps/systemd-baselayout, and sys-apps/systemd-sysv-utils:

          =sys-apps/sysvinit-tools-2.88-r2 ~amd64
          =sys-apps/systemd-baselayout-2.0.3 ~amd64
          =sys-apps/systemd-sysv-utils-37 ~amd64

  5. Edit /etc/portage/package.unmask and add sys-apps/systemd-sysv-utils to
     it:

          =sys-apps/kmod-6
          =sys-apps/systemd-sysv-utils-37

  6. If necessary, add sys-apps/kmod to /etc/portage/package.keywords, and
     unmask sys-apps/kmod:

          /etc/portage/package.keywords:
          =sys-apps/kmod-6 ~amd64

          /etc/portage/package.unmask:
          =sys-apps/kmod-6

  7. Uninstall sys-apps/openrc, sys-apps/baselayout and sys-apps/sysvinit:

          emerge --unmerge --verbose sys-apps/openrc sys-apps/baselayout \
          sys-apps/sysvinit

  8. See if you can upgrade the world:

          emerge --newuse --deep --update --verbose --pretend world

     If the emerge is feasible, go for it:

          emerge --newuse --deep --update --verbose world

     If you have to keyword and unmask packages, do it and try again.
     If in the pretended emerge, sys-apps/openrc, sys-apps/baselayout or sys-
     apps/sysvinit try to get installed again, it means that you have a package
     installed that needs them, and for which there is no alternative in this
     overlay. You can get back to the backup you did in step 1 (you did it,
     right?), and simply install again sys-apps/openrc, sys-apps/baselayout and
     sys-apps/sysvinit, or you can track the offending package and create an
     alternative ebuild that uses the replacements in this overlay (please send
     it to me if you do). If you don't know how to do it, you can send me the
     output of the pretendend emerge so I can create the alternative ebuild,
     integrate it in the overlay, and then you will be able to do the emerge.


OpenRC init scripts

Please note that the instructions from above only remove the package sys-apps/
openrc: they do nothing to prevent arbitrary packages to install init scripts
on /etc/init.d. If you want to avoid the installation of init scripts on /etc/
init.d, please edit /etc/make.conf with an appropriate INSTALL_MASK variable.

  1. (Optional) Add the following directories to INSTALL_MASK in /etc/
     make.conf:

          /etc/init.d
          /etc/conf.d
          /etc/runlevels

     In time, those directories will be empty. If you feel adventurous, you can
     delete them: they should not matter if you use systemd.

This is the same for users of OpenRC who don't want to have installed systemd
service files on /usr/lib/systemd: they need to set up an appropriate
INSTALL_MASK variable in /etc/make.conf.

Getting cold feet

If you want to get back to the normal portage configuration, just uninstall
every package from the overlay, delete the overlay and restore your backup from
step 1 (you did a backup, right?). You then do

     emerge --newuse --deep --update --verbose world

and, in theory, everything should get back to normal.

The bug #373219 (https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=373219)

Bug #373219 (https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=373219) deals with the
fact that there are scripts all over the portage tree which implicitly depend
on sys-apps/openrc since they source /etc/init.d/functions.sh. The devs
responsible for OpenRC seems to resist the idea of splitting the e* log
functions from OpenRC (which is what most of the scripts on the tree seems to
be using) into another package, so if you remove OpenRC (which is one of the
goals of this overlay), you loose /etc/init.d/functions.sh and therefore some
scripts on the tree will stop working.
To workaround this, I'm introducing sys-libs/elog-functions, which provides
full compatibilty functions for the e* log functions from OpenRC, and I'm
introducing alternative versions of packages that depend (implicitly) on OpenRC
so this new versions will depend on sys-libs/elog-functions. Right now that's:

* app-admin/perl-cleaner
* app-admin/python-updater
* app-portage/gentoolkit
* dev-java/java-config-wrapper
* sys-devel/binutils-config
* sys-devel/gcc-config

They all seem to work in my systems, but please inform me if you find any
problem. Also, if you know about other package depending implicitly on OpenRC,
please let me know.
Besides these packages, sys-libs/glibc provides the /usr/sbin/locale-gen
script, and sys-devel/gcc provides /sbin/fix_libtool_files.sh (also on /usr/
share/gcc-data/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/${PV}/fix_libtool_files.sh). Both scripts
sources /etc/init.d/functions.sh, but the ebuilds are complex enough for me to
even try to provide alternatives.
Therefore, in the no-openrc-scripts directory of this overlay you will find
alternative versions of both locale-gen and fix_libtool_files.sh, that you can
replace by hand.
If you emerge sys-libs/glibc or sys-devel/gcc without OpenRC, the ebuild will
print an error when it tries to execute an script that cannot source /etc/
init.d/functions.sh; however, the installation will complete correctly, and you
can run the scripts provided here afterwards.

Changes from the official portage tree

You can see the (simple) changes that the ebuilds in this overlay make by doing
a diff to the corresponding ebuilds in the portage tree.

* app-admin/perl-cleaner, app-admin/python-updater, app-portage/gentoolkit,
  dev-java/java-config-wrapper, sys-devel/binutils-config, sys-devel/gcc-
  config:

  o Depend on sys-libs/elog-functions and source /usr/lib/misc/elog-
    functions.sh instead of /etc/init.d/functions.sh.
    Bug #373219 (https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=373219).

* net-dns/avahi:

  o Use the systemd eclass:
    Bug #366173 (https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=366173).

* sys-apps/systemd:

  o Depend on new package sys-apps/sysvinit-tools instead of sys-apps/sysvinit,
    and also depend on sys-apps/systemd-sysv-utils:
    Bug #399615 (https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=399615).
  o Introduce "doc" USE flag to conditionally depend on app-text/docbook2X,
    necessary to build the man pages.
    Bug #405703 (https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=405703).

* sys-apps/udev:

  o Do not depend on sys-apps/baselayout:
    No bug filled until sys-apps/systemd-baselayout is good enough as to ask
    for its inclusion in the portage tree.
  o Do not depend on sys-fs/udev-init-scripts:
    The package sys-fs/udev-init-scripts contains init scripts, a udev script
    to call the init scripts, and a rule file to run the udev script that calls
    the init scripts. All of this is redundant with systemd. There is also a
    simple 40-gentoo.rules rule file: This file belongs in the udev package.
    Bug #408379 (https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=408379).

* sys-kernel/dracut:

  o Depend on new package sys-apps/systemd-baselayout instead of sys-apps/
    baselayout:
    Same as above.
  o Depend on sys-apps/systemd-sysv-utils instead of sys-apps/sysvinit:
    No bug filled until bug #399615 (https://bugs.gentoo.org/
    show_bug.cgi?id=399615) gets fixed and sys-apps/systemd-sysv-utils gets
    unmasked.
  o Depend on new package sys-apps/sysvinit-tools:
    Bug #399615 (https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=399615).



New packages:


* sys-apps/sysvinit-tools:
  Split some utilities from sys-apps/sysvinit, in response to bug #399615
  (https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=399615).
* sys-apps/systemd-baselayout:
  Add systemd base configuration files:
